        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about p">Hi! My name is Roberto Reyes and I am a recent 
          Electrical Engineering graduate with a focus on 
          Software Engineering from The University of Texas 
          at Austin. I'm experienced in Python, Java, C, C++, Assembly, 
          React, Flask, HTML, and CSS. I have worked on many 
          projects, some of which involve web development, 
          real-time communication, data management, and 
          algorithm design. 
        </p>
        <p class="about p">Some of the notable projects I have worked on include 
          a Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS) web application, a 
          multi-client auction system in Java, a Spotify 
          recommendation engine, and a dynamic programming 
          algorithm for Atlantis food optimization. I am committed 
          to continuous skill development and learning, and I'm 
          passionate about creating innovative software solutions.
          I am eager to contribute to a team that values collaboration, 
          growth, and excellence in software engineering. Feel free 
          to explore my GitHub repositories and connect with me on 
          LinkedIn to learn more about my work and interests.

          <h3>Personalized Spotify Music Recommendations</h3>
          <p>Description: A web application built with Node.js, 
            HTML, AJAX, and the Spotify API to analyze a user's 
            listening habits and provide tailored music recommendations. 
            The app extracts user profile and listening data to generate 
            a list of personalized song suggestions based on their preferences.

          <h3>Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS) Web Application</h3>
          <p>Description: A team-developed proof of concept (PoC) for 
            a Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS) web application, designed 
            to enable users to securely manage projects and request 
            available hardware resources. The project utilized React.js 
            for the frontend, Python Flask for the backend, and MongoDB 
            for data management. Agile methodologies, daily standups, 
            and GitHub boards were used for effective team collaboration. 
            The application was deployed on Heroku.

          <h3>Real-time Java Auction System</h3>
          <p>Description: A multi-client auction system developed using JavaFX 
            for GUI, multithreading, and socket programming for real-time 
            client-server communication. The project involved implementing an 
            auction server to manage item data, bids, and user connections, as 
            well as creating a client-side UI with bidding and item information 
            features. An Item class was designed to represent auction items, and 
            a JSON file was used for data storage and management.

          <h3>Atlantis Discovered: Dynamic Programming</h3>
          <p>Description: An engaging dynamic programming project aimed at maximizing 
            food collection in the mythical underwater city of Atlantis. The project 
            involved devising a strategic wall placement algorithm to safeguard 
            resources against a relentless enemy. The Atlantis Food Optimization 
            project showcases the power of dynamic programming in solving intricate 
            problems and underlines the appeal of algorithmic challenges.
